# Abby Bigaouette

**Space Coast, FL** · (918) 506-1265 · abby@bigaouette.com · [bigaouette.com](https://bigaouette.com)

Aerospace technician building a road to space. At Blue Origin I build New Glenn's first stage subassemblies — fluid systems, cryogenic insulation, avionics, and precision machining on flight hardware. In my free time I develop liquid rocket engines, fly experimental rockets, and write open source software to make complex work more accessible.



## Experience

### Subassembly Technician II, Blue Origin
#### **2024 – Present**

- Assemble and test pneumatic, hydraulic, and monopropellant subassemblies for New Glenn's first stage.
- Install high-performance cryogenic insulation systems (Cryogel-Z, SOFI, MLI) and proprietary thermal protection materials.
- Operate in cleanroom and ESD controlled environments to preserve component cleanliness and system integrity.
- Perform precision drilling, reaming, and machining operations on large-scale aerospace structures using hand and power tools.
- Certified in Laser Operation and part marking per AS478 and internal specifications.
- Inspect parts and assemblies using calipers, micrometers, dial indicators, and engineer's scales to verify dimensional conformance.
- Interpret engineering drawings, GD&T callouts, and 3D models in Creo to execute complex build sequences.
- Perform avionics work including soldering, wire harness fabrication, installation, connector pinning, and inspection.
- Assist in rigging and crane operations for oversized and heavy components.
- Document all work per AS9100-compliant procedures; execute and provide feedback on work instructions.
- Support test campaigns including setup, execution, and teardown of high-pressure proof tests, leak tests, and system-level functional checkouts; log data and complete test documentation per procedure requirements.
- Contributed code bugfixes to internal software products.

### Head of Design, Tahlequah Daily Press
#### **2022 – 2024**

- Managed production of two daily newspapers and 10+ annual magazines, coordinating across editorial, advertising, and print teams.
- Overhauled production workflows, leading to an 88% improvement in ability to meet daily print deadlines.



## Projects

### OPAL (Operations, Procedures, Assets, Logistics)
#### **2026 – Present**

- Building lightweight ERP software for small teams building complex hardware, with CAD integration with Onshape.
- Supports AI agent integration with out-of-box MCP server.

### Liquid Propulsion
#### **2023 – Present**

- Developing a 1000N (225 lbf) IPA/nitrous oxide bipropellant engine, including GSE design, propellant handling, and test operations.
- Fired a subscale hybrid motor, gaining hands-on experience with high-pressure gas systems, nitrous oxide handling, and test stand setup/teardown.
- Fabricate custom fluid lines including tube bending, flaring, and oxygen-compatible cleaning for propellant system components.

### Project Longinus
#### **2023 – Present**

- Designed, assembled, and debugged custom avionics PCBs including RP2040-based flight computers with dual-redundant pyro channels and LoRa telemetry.
- Created detailed engineering drawings and work instructions for suppliers and assembly operations.
- Fabricates airframe components using composites layup and vacuum bagging.
